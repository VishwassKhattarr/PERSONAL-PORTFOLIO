  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section class="section" id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy building complete systems rather than isolated features.
      That usually means working across the stack and thinking about how
      different parts of a system fit together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m interested in full-stack development and machine learning,
      especially where automation and real-world constraints matter.
